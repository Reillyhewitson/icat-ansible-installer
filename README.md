# icat-ansible-installer

This is an example of a composite action for setting up and installing ICAT via ansible. It is currently working for the python tests on [datagateway-api/fix/ansible-composite-action](https://github.com/ral-facilities/datagateway-api/tree/fix/ansible-composite-action) with an implementation for the generator consistency not functioning.
